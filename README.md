## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Unified Library**: Manage both local EPUB files and web novels in one place.
* **EPUB Upload**: Easily upload your existing `.epub` files directly through the web UI.
* **Web Novel Tracking**: Simply add a URL, and InkWell will download the story and package it as an EPUB.
* **Automatic Updates**: A background scheduler periodically checks for new chapters for all your tracked web novels using FanFicFare.
* **Stub Protection**: InkWell is configured to **never delete old chapters**, so you won't lose content if an author removes it from the source to publish commercially.
* **API-First Design**: A robust backend API allows for integration with other applications, such as a future mobile e-reader or audiobook player.
* **(Future) Audiobook Conversion**: Planned integration for background text-to-speech conversion to turn any book in your library into an audiobook.
